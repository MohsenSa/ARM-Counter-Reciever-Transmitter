# ARM-Counter-Reciever-Transmitter

In this project with the help of the STM32 Smart v2.0 and an 2*16 LCD and a pair of infrared reciever and transmitter,a motion detector is built.In here we take advantage of the counter and timer concept within the stm32 microcontroller(in this case an stm32f103c8t6 is used) and we pick up the external pulses sent by the transmitter.Whenever an object moves around the transmitter it disrupts the flow of infrared signals picked up by the it,thus creating a pulse that is sent to the counter in the micro.
Note:For the setup to work properly,suitable resistors should be used along with the reciever and the transmitter and it's dependant to the enivroment you're in.
This project was built by CubeMX and Keil.
Also if interested you can contact me in order to get the entire project(which is not brought here due to technical restrictions).
